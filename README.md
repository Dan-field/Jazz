Python Music work relating to development of automatic improvisation

This repository will contain my development of a jazz improvisor using Python Music. This project started in January 2017 and is expected to run through 2017 and 2018 with completion of the code around mid-2019.

Note that the development took something of a detour after version 0.07, due to a collaborative project involving 'Musebots'. Most of the development work through 2018 was related to Musebots. Version numbering skips straight from 0.11 (Vancouver Musebot version) to 0.20 which is the 'final draft' version intended to be released as version 1.0 some time in the first half of 2019. The reason for this skip is that some local copies of higher-numbered versions were started during the second half of 2018 in relation to the Text2SATB project; version 0.20 is a 'clean break' rebuild from the ground up.

The Python files require the Python Music Library to run and may not run in a standard Python environment - in fact they run in the 'Jython Environment for Music' (JEM). Although most of the language the same as Python 2.7, I have noticed this environment differs significantly in its GUI-related functions and also in its threading-related functions. Check out jythonmusic.org for the details and to download the environment. I am using the book 'Making Music with Computers' by Bill Manaris and Andrew R. Brown as my music library reference and primer. To run the program yourself, save all of the files into the same folder together and then run the 'version' file, for example v0-06.py.

Some of the early versions include demos recorded using Band in a Box for backing and notation. These early demos can be viewed in the Youtube channel https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCGTlKqu5PkC1CRh0mL5bTdA

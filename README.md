Python Music work relating to development of automatic improvisation

This repository will contain my development of a jazz improvisor using Python Music. This project started in January 2017 and is expected to run through 2017 and 2018.

The Python files require the Python Music Library to run - in fact they run in a Jython environment. Check out jythonmusic.org for the details and the environment. I am using the book 'Making Music with Computers' by Bill Manaris and Andrew R. Brown as my music library reference and primer.

Demos are being recorded using Band in a Box for backing and notation. The demos can be viewed in the Youtube channel https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCGTlKqu5PkC1CRh0mL5bTdA
